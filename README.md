# Neural-Architecture-Search-Improved-Version
 In this framework, a teacher model improves itself by teaching a student model to learn well. Specifically, the teacher creates a pseudo-labeled dataset and uses it to train a student model. Based on how the student performs on a validation dataset, the teacher re-learns its model and re-teaches the student until the student achieves great validation performance. Our framework is based on three-level optimization which contains three stages: teacher learns; teacher teaches student; teacher re-learns based on how well the student performs.It is a replication of https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07009
